==Scenario 1:  EDI-to-XML transformation==

===Description===

In the beginning we created in Talend a simple Java job using only *tSmooks* component. The component implements the Smooks data EDI-to-XML transformation.
Then we complicated the scenario and used standard Talend component to provide data into the Talend flow.
*TSmooks* component performs data conversion and stores the result in the file.  Then the resulting file name it saves in a Talend Job global Map. Next job component uses file name as parameter.

==Scenario 2: Interaction with the standard components. Complex Iterate-EDI-to-XML-to-XML transform.==

===Description===

This scenario demonstrates interaction  tSmooks with standard Talend components by triggered and Iterate connectors. We use two *tSmooks* components in this Job, the first for the EDI-to-XML processing, the second for XML-to-XML transformation. The resulting data we provide into Talend flow and display it on the Log.
